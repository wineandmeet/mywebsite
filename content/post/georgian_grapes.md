Georgia has approximately 530 indigeneous grape wines, which is considerable when you think that worldwide there are around 10 000 ! Georgia alone has 1/20 of the worldwide wine varieties !

Many of them are grown in "wine libraries", but the 2 most commonly used are :

- Saperavi grape has red flesh and red skin! It gives often fully opaque wines with a lot of tannic and rich aromas such as dark berries, licorice, grilled meat, tobacco, chocolate and spices. It can age for decades but often it is mixed to other grapes for balance. It is a typical red wine from Kakheti region.
- Rkatsiteli is the most used white grape. Georgian's table wine is white as red has a reputation to increase blood pressure, which is absolutely not needed for this very warm and sometimes overly emotional nation! Rkatsiteli gives balanced wines with good body and acidity. When used with the european methods it yields to green fruits aromas,while Qvevri methods yields to more complex aromas.
