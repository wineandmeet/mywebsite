<p><img alt="Sparkling" src="/img/11emedomaine_sparkling.jpeg" /></p>
<p>We began our wine tasting with a sparkling wine from Saumure, it has subtile bubbles with white flower aromas that extend into more generous while balanced taste.</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain name: Chateau de Montguéret</li>
<li>Region : Saumure, Loire, France</li>
<li>Grapes: 60% Chenin Blanc, 20% Chardonnay, 15% Cabernet Franc, 5% Grolleau Gris</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="white-wines">White Wines</h1>
<p><img alt="White" src="/img/11emedomaine_whites.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The first white wine was fresh with golden apple, acacia flower and  flint aromas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain name: Domaine des Terres blanches</li>
<li>Region: Pouilly-Fumé, Loire, France</li>
<li>Grape: Sauvignon</li>
</ul>
<p>The second white wine feeled the sun! It was generous with a lot of white flower aromas, honey and had a full body with butter notes, "brioché".</p>
<ul>
<li>Domaine Name: Clos Val Seille</li>
<li>Region: Côtes du Rhône, France</li>
<li>Grapes: Roussane, Marsanne</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="red-wines">Red Wines</h1>
<p><img alt="Red" src="/img/11emedomaine_reds.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The first red wine was a subtile and fresh wine from Bourgundy. It has strawberry and fresh grass aromas while the body was acidic, fresh. A typical Burgundy wine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain Name: Domaine René Bouvier</li>
<li>Region: Marsannay, Bourgogne, France</li>
<li>Grape: 100% Pinot Noir</li>
</ul>
<p>The second red wine was much more full bodied. It feeled the sun as it came from Languedoc region. It has very intense aromas with red fruits, dry fig, cacao, licorice, spices and vanilla finale ! Full bodied with silky tanins but strong spice taste. Great with grilled red meat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain Name: Domaine Belles Courbes</li>
<li>Region: Saint-Chinian, Languedoc, France</li>
<li>Grapes: Carignan, Grenache, Syrah</li>
