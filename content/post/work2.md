Thanks to domaine des poncetys with this les terres blanches a saint-veran appelation wine from burgundy. Enjoy it's sunny color, aromas of honey, benzine, lemon, minerality. The body is tense due to its acidity and freshness balanced by a residual honey sweetness. At last enjoy the herbal finish. Great with sea food !
