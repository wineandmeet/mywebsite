During my trip in Georgia, I discovered the Qvevri wine-making process.
A Qvevri is a big jar put in the soil where wine is fermented. The process uses grapes, the skins, the stalks and pips which give very remarkable wines. Generally the process goes as follows:
- grapes are pressed in satsnakheli (wine press)
- Chacha is poured in Qvevri (pomace: grape skins, stalks and pips)
- after fermentation it is sealed for aging for 6 months roughly

However we can distinguish two different styles:
- kakhetian style (from eastern georgia) which uses all the Chacha
- Imeretian style uses only 1/10 of the Chacha

Kakhetian style give very tannic wines and with very concentrated and natural aromas, such as honey, apples, pine.
On the other side, Imeretian style gives wines more similar to the european style, but yet with the Qvevri singularity.

[You can find more details on the unesco web site](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/ancient-georgian-traditional-qvevri-wine-making-method-00870)

If you are curious of Qvevri, try a Georgian a restaurant in your town. For Paris you can try the [Colchide](https://www.facebook.com/colchide.paris18/?ref=hl)

I hope I gave you some interest in visiting Georgia.

Alexandre.
