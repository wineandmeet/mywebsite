Dear reader,

I am happy to share with you a great wine we discovered while travelling across Georgia.

The producer is Peradze winery based in the Khaketi region, more precisely in kindzmarauli. This region is famous for producing wines form the saperavi grape, which is very strong in tannins.

It has been produced using traditional vinification and lasted in oak barrels for 9 months.

Here are some wine tasting notes :

- smell: red fruits
- taste: precise acidity with soft tannins. It has red fruits aromas, with jammed cherry, blackcurrant and then goes into coffee, vanilla and menthol finish.

I hope you will enjoy.
