The first red wine was a subtile and fresh wine from Bourgundy. It has strawberry and fresh grass aromas while the body was acidic, fresh. A typical Burgundy wine.

- Domain Name: Domaine René Bouvier
- Region: Marsannay, Bourgogne, France
- Grape: 100% Pinot Noir

The second red wine was much more full bodied. It feeled the sun as it came from Languedoc region. It has very intense aromas with red fruits, dry fig, cacao, licorice, spices and vanilla finale ! Full bodied with silky tanins but strong spice taste. Great with grilled red meat.

- Region: Saint-Chinian, Languedoc, France
- Grapes: Carignan, Grenache, Syrah
