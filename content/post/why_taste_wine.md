Taste and smell are the poorest developped senses in human beings. Contrary to dogs, you do not recognize you best friend my his smell :-)

That's why our taste and smell are so often biased by:

- social conventions: many studies show that expensive wines are perceived as being better. We can say the same for the wines with a reknown etiquette.
- previous experiences: You remember with disgust the spninach your mother forced you to eat, even if it is in a great italian restaurant !
- habits: When you are accustomed to cooked meat only, you find very strange to eat medium raw meat as we do in France.The same can be said for wines, when you are accustomed to white wines, you find very strange the tannins in red wines.

For all these reasons, wine tasting may be perceived in the mass culture as a ritual without true foundation whose sole purpose is to mark one's membership in the social elite.

But those who visited a wineyard and noticed the hard work it reprensents, and the joy of the producer tasting with you and explaining the meaning of his/her work (like an artist), you understand how wine can be an authentic and true work of art.

Furthermore, this point of view is swept away by recend trends. Firstly wine access has been democratized, indeed good wines are now cheap, we can find very good wines for just about 20â‚¬. Secondly environmental values have become popular, whith a better respect of the "terroir", the link to nature and the work of the wine maker.

These reasons have made wine tasting popular, as you seen by the growing number of wine bar in the hipster neighboorhoods. But to ensure a proper and authentic understanding of wine tasting, you need to master some techniques that we call the art of wine tasting.

So keep posted as we will go through the main steps of wine tasting in our next post.

Cheers.

PS: To be fair, all our perceptions are biased by so many things. But what's great in wine tasting, is that actively tasting will make your senses evolve. This may be quite disturbing, but it is great to learn from new experience and overcome previous preconceptions !
