Taste and smell are the poorest developped senses in human beings. Contrary to dogs, we do not recognize our best friend by his smell :-)

That's why our taste and smell are so often biased by:

- social conventions: many studies show that expensive wines are perceived as being better. We can say the same for the wines with a reknown label.
- previous experiences: You remember with disgust the spinach your mother forced you to eat, even if it is in a great italian restaurant !
- habits: When you are accustomed to cooked meat only, you find very strange to eat medium raw meat as we do in France.The same can be said for wines, when you are accustomed to white wines, you find very strange the tannins in red wines.

For all these reasons, wine tasting may be perceived in the mass culture as a ritual without true foundation whose sole purpose is to mark one's membership in the social elite.

But those who visited a wineyard and noticed the hard work it represents, and the joy of the producer tasting with you and explaining the meaning of his/her work (like an artist), you understand how wine can be an authentic and true work of art.

Furthermore, this point of view is swept away by recent trends. Firstly wine access has been democratized, today good wines are cheaper. Secondly environmental values have become popular, whith a better respect of the "terroir", the link to nature and the work of the wine maker.

These reasons have made wine tasting popular, considering the growing number of wine bars. But to ensure a proper and authentic understanding of wine tasting, you need to master some techniques that we call the art of wine tasting. These techniques will enable you to :

- discover new wines and new sensations.
- overcome your bias.
- learn the vocabulary of wine tasting.
- share with others your sensations.
- understand the interaction between nature, weather and the work of the wine maker.
- enjoy the numerous subtleties of a great wine !

So keep posted as we will go through the main steps of wine tasting in our next post.

Cheers.

PS: To be fair, all our perceptions are biased by so many things. But what's great in wine tasting, is that progressively tasting will make your senses evolve. This may be quite disturbing, but it is great to learn from new experience and overcome previous preconceptions !
