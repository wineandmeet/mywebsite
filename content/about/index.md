I am Alex, a wine enthusiast.

Some years ago, I visited a vineyard and discovered the work of the wine maker. He works on nature mastering numerous processes before giving birth to wine, and tries to express his art through the taste of the wine. It was an immersive experience during which I felt deeply connected.

Back to Paris, I reminded these beautiful memories through the tasting of wines brought, and only then understood the roman proverb "In Vino Veritas".

I created this website to share with you my passion. Furthermore, I created a [group][1] in Paris, organizing friendly wine tastings during which I explain how to taste wine.

See you soon.

Alex,
