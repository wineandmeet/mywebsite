      <description>Thanks to domaine des poncetys with this les terres blanches a saint-veran appelation wine from burgundy. Enjoy it&amp;rsquo;s sunny color, aromas of honey, benzine, lemon, minerality. The body is tense due to its acidity and freshness balanced by a residual honey sweetness. At last enjoy the herbal finish. Great with sea food !</description>

      <description>I am Alex, a wine enthusiast.
Some years ago, I visited a vineyard and discovered the work of the wine maker. He works on nature mastering numerous processes before giving birth to wine, and tries to express his art through the taste of the wine. It was an immersive experience during which I felt deeply connected.
Back to Paris, I reminded these beautiful memories through the tasting of wines brought, and only then understood the roman proverb &amp;ldquo;In Vino Veritas&amp;rdquo;.</description>
